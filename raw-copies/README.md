# Gettting the raw official copies

Note that this is a work in progress, and the list of constitutions is not complete.
When getting the official copies, ensure that the translation are 1:1 (aka same edition, etc).
Also ensure you are only taking from official sources. And validate that they are copy right free.

# How do I grow this raw dataset?

If you have a copy of a constitution, and its official translation, please submit a pull request.

You can refer to the wikipedia entry of multilingual nations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilingual_countries_and_regions
