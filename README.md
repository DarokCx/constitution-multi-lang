# Constitution Multi Lang

A collection of multiple nation, constitutional legal documents, with their official language translation.

## Rationale behind this

This project aims to get the official translation pairs of various **non-english** constitutions, of various nations.
Due to the importance of such documents on a nation, it is expected that the translation pairs are of high quality.
Additional in many cases, official goverment documents are "copyright free", removing any legal issues in the training process.

This also provides an easy scalable way to get reliable translation pairs for AI training.
